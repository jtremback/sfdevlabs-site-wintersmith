A Texan, an Australian and a guy from Vermont all walk into a
bar. They each order a drink - and recognizing a likeness in each other
they got to talking, but not before ordering a second drink, and then
another.

Nobody quite knows what happened that night but by the end of
it they had solidified their friendship and were forming a dev shop
together, for between them they could build just about
anything. Moreover, they were agreed that Node was
better than Ruby, “responsive design” was saying the same thing as
“design”, and that client work was a great way to make a living -
except during Burning Man, when they would all be taking time
off.

_- Watch this space -_

Sincerely,

**Jeff, Eoin &amp; Jehan**
