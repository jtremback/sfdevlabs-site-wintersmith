We designed this trio of concept apps for the Eros Fos Kickstarter. Fos is a flexible LED display that can be sewn into clothing, and we were tasked with designing three apps to show what it could be used for.

Joggly is a fitness tracking app that shows the user stats about their run, as well as playing music. It connects to the Fos display to display stats and animations while the user is exercising.

Sparklemotion is a dance app. It allows the user to select from a range of music visualizations. The selected visualization is then displayed on Fos.

Cyclomatic is a cycling app which shows the user the best route to take, as well as providing synchronized turn signals on the Fos display to improve safety while biking.
