BioFab is a project of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, aiming to be the “world’s first biological design-build facility”.

BioFab has put together a huge database of DNA snippets. These snippets can be combined in various ways with genes, controlling what quantity of the gene is produced, and the gene’s reliability across organisms. BioFab’s research allows scientists to fine-tune exactly how an inserted gene will behave, and where it will work.

Working in close collaboration with their software lead, Marc Juul, I designed the Expression Designer to allow researchers to to quickly sift through the large volumes of data that BioFab has produced. 

* The user selects a range of performance with the main slider.
* The user adds constraints, filtering by sequences they wish to include and exclude.
* The user receives a list of Expression Operating Units (EOU’s) represented by expandable widgets.
