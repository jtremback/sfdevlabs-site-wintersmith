Scope is an app designed to help people get the most out of conferences and other events. It allows users to view the event program on their phones and select the talks they are interested in. I focused on minimalism in this design.

The entire interface is coded in haml and sass, allowing it to be deployed in a Rails app. The plan from there was to offer it to conferences as a service. We enter their schedule into the database, their attendees use the app, we get paid.

Fun fact: this design uses no images, for fast loading. All visual effects are accomplished with css3.
